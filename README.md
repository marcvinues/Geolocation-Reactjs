```bash
npm install and npm run dev

## Usage

Need to change .env.example to .env and put API key from GoogleMaps to run it.

## Improvements

Extract some functions in other components to get more dynamic the code also for escalability, We can use Redux Saga insted of Redux Thunk.

We can use Styled Components insted of Sass, another Library to Geolocate like MapBox
